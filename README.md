# 🐍 Python Basics – Loops & Strings

This repository contains code examples and practice problems focusing on **loops** and **string manipulation** in Python. These are foundational concepts especially useful in **data analytics**, where automation, data cleaning, and text processing are key.

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🔁 Loops
- `for` and `while` loops  
- Using `range()` for controlled iteration  
- Looping through strings and lists  
- Nested loops  
- Loop control: `break`, `continue`

### 🧵 String Manipulation
- Indexing and slicing  
- String traversal using loops  
- Common string methods:
  - `.lower()`, `.upper()`
  - `.strip()`, `.replace()`
  - `.find()`, `.count()`
  - `.startswith()`, `.endswith()`
  - Using `in` keyword for search
- Concatenation and formatting

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Examples
This repo includes solutions to common string and loop-based problems such as:
- Reversing a string
- Counting vowels and consonants
- Checking for palindromes
- Finding frequency of characters
- Parsing strings from user input

Each example is written with comments and simple logic so that beginners can easily follow along.
